Troubleshooting:
----------------
Issue: Under 30 fps on 1920x1080 resolution RGB Camera stream
Cause: Automatically detected inter-packet delay too high
Solution:
- Lower the inter-packet delay manually if your use case requires RGB stream with resolution 1920x1080 at 30fps
    - Note that lower inter-packet delay than the one detected may have a negative effect on performance of 
    other stream combinations
    - Please consult the Tuning System For Best Performance App Note for details on setting the correct inter-packet 
    delay
