	- to run example click: Operate > Run
	


	Errors, Bugs and Issues
	======================

	- potential bug:
		- after closing some .vi, LabVIEW can still be see running in Windows Task Manager under background processes
		- only with framos-librealsense library
		- reproducing steps:
			- open labview wrapper, for example RealSense_HelloWorld_Depth_and_Monochrome.vi and run it with D4xxe device
			- stop example with STOP button
			- click File > Exit, no need to save
			- open same of another example and try to run it again --> it won't work --> errors will be shown

		- shown errors:
			- Error calling rs2_start_queue (sensor:000001E7BC51E4E0, queue:000001E7BC637BD0):
 			  start_streaming(...) failed. CS device was not opened!
			- Error calling rs2_wait_for_frame (queue:000001E7BC637BD0):
 			  Frame did not arrive in time!
			- Error calling rs2_stop (sensor:000001E7BC51E4E0):
 			  stop_streaming() failed. CS device is not streaming!
			  Error calling rs2_close (sensor:000001E7BC51E4E0): 
 			  close() failed. CS device was not opened!

		- this seems to be problem only for D4xxe devices
		





	- error:	dll initialization routine failed

		- possible solution:	
			- https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z0000019MJqSAM&l=en-HR
			- check for updates in NI Package Manager
			- even if you using 64bit LabVIEW, you must updated 32bit version or even previous versions of LabVIEW

		- possible solution:

			 - check for installed packages:		
				- last installed package (Smartek CameraSuite or Framos CameraSuite + Framos librealsense			  
				  modifies path to GenICam location 
				- adjust priority to apropriate loacation under PATH env variable




	- error 1097:	Error in external library call...

		- possible reason & solution:			
			- external function (most probably from dll) did not received correct parameters, or did not
			  received enough parameters
			- occurs often when camera does not support selected profile (resolution@fps)



	- error 0x02: Memory is full

		- possible reason:
			- occurs often when trying to run a command-window-specific command

		- solution:
			- https://knowledge.ni.com/KnowledgeArticleDetails?id=kA00Z0000019L12SAE&l=en-HR
			- to run command prompt commands from the System Exec VI, 
			  execute the command prompt window first with the following command:

				cmd /c

			- for example, when calling script Script1.bat execute:

				cmd /c Script1.bat
